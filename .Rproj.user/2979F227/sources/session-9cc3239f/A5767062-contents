# Teaching Philosophy

As a student, I learn best by understanding complex ideas through simple illustrations. I start with the big picture and then fill in the details later. This holistic perspective has helped me throughout my educational journey, and I believe it is essential for all students.

I think that there are three critical elements of education: student-centered learning, an inclusive classroom, and diversified grading systems and teaching tools.

  * *Student-centered learning* is important because it allows students to learn in a way that is most effective for them. I use a variety of instructional methods to engage students, such as group activities, worksheets, visualizations, and traditional lectures. I also provide detailed feedback and support so that students can reach their full potential.

  * An *inclusive classroom* is meaningful because it creates a safe and welcoming environment where all students feel welcome, respected, and supported. I create an inclusive classroom by using inclusive language, celebrating diversity, and being aware of and addressing bias.

  * *Diversified grading systems and teaching tools* are essential because they allow me to assess student learning in a fair and equitable way. I use a variety of grading methods and teaching tools, such as proficiency-based grading system, rubrics, portfolios, and self-assessment. This allows me to assess student learning in a way that is tailored to each student's individual needs.
