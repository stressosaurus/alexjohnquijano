      "description": "Hi, I'm Alex. I was born and raised in the Philippines. I lived there until I was 15 when I migrated to the United States with my mother and sister. I am an amateur artist, and my hobbies include painting, drawing, and playing video games. I also like cooking, eating, and traveling.\n",

My dissertation was titled “Mathematical Models of Natural Language Evolution.”\r\nIn my dissertation, I focused on three main areas:\r\nModeling word rank evolution: I developed a mathematical model to predict how the frequency of words changes over time.\r\nExploring the evolution of contextual semantics: I investigated how the meaning of words changes depending on the context in which they are used.\r\nEvaluating the accuracy of reading comprehension tasks: I used machine learning to fine-tune a pre-trained language model to predict whether a human will correctly answer a reading comprehension question.\r\n\r\nB.S. in Mathematics | East Tennessee State University | 2015\r\nMy undergraduate “thesis” was about stochastic modeling of spider predation movements.\r\nThere are more details about me on my Curriculum Vitae.\r\n\r\nCV\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nI am interested in the mathematical applications of data science in interdisciplinary research, particularly the mathematical modeling of natural languages, social and biological systems. I am also interested in generating insights from data to inform researchers in evolutionary linguistics, sociology, mathematical biology, and decision-makers in social justice initiatives.\r\nRead More…\r\n\r\nTeaching\r\nI am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Portland. I primarily teach courses in calculus, ordinary differential equations, probability and statistics, applied statistics, and data science. In my courses I apply (a) student-centered learning by using a variety of instructional methods to engage students, (b) inclusive classroom by creating a safe and welcoming environment, and (c) diversified grading systems and teaching tools, such as think-pair-share activities, proficiency-based grading systems, and group work.\r\nRead More…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Google Ngram data is used to analyze eight languages and compared it to\r\nthe model that simulates drift evolution. The time-series evolutionary dynamics of\r\nword ranks are investigated by adjusting the model parameters and comparing it to\r\nthe language data.\r\nPreprint:\r\nA Statistical Model of Word Rank Evolution\r\nExamining and Modeling Police Response and Crime Reporting\r\nCollaborators: Ben Yarrish, Laurel Ponce, and Sajid Bin Mahammud. 1\r\nThis project investigates the relationship between crime rates and policing in the United States. We are using mathematical and statistical modeling, data science methods, and city-wide data to answer key questions, such as: How does law enforcement response vary with changes in crime rates? How do community perceptions of law enforcement change based on their presence? What are the effects of police presence on marginalized communities? The project’s findings will inform public policy and enhance community-police relations.\r\nPosters:\r\nA Data-Driven Model of Portland Policing\r\nPast Projects\r\nAnalysis of Twitter Texts\r\nCollaborators: Maia Powell, Ayme Tomson, Suzanne Sindi, & Arnold Kim\r\nThe goal is to uncover the discourse and evolution behind certain hashtag social movements using NLP methods, machine learning algorithms, and language models. Twitter data was collected and processed using NLTK and several Python tools.\r\nPoster:\r\nEvolving Contextual Semantics\r\nPerformance Analysis on Question Answering\r\nCollaborators: Sam Nguyen & Juanita Ordonez\r\nThe objective was to fine-tune and evaluate three language models named BERT, ALBERT, and LongFormer on question answering data set called DuoRC where it contains movie plots with narrative structures. Due to the complexity and length of narrative texts, these models are needed to not only answer the question but must also go beyond its capabilities to perform complex reasoning and reading comprehension to infer answers to questions.\r\nPreprint:\r\nGrid Search Hyperparameter Benchmarking of BERT, ALBERT, and LongFormer on DuoRC\r\nPresentation:\r\nWord Embedding Models Performance Analysis on a Question Answering Task\r\nMachine Learning Application on Opacity\r\nCollaborators: Robert C. Blake & Ben C. Yee\r\nThe objective was to encode opacity - a material property on how much radiation can pass through it - into a neural network as a surrogate model against an existing atomic physics code.\r\nPoster:\r\nApplication of Convolutional Neural Network on Radiative Opacity Computations\r\nTwitter Network Analysis of the California Camp Fire\r\nCollaborators: Maia Powell & Matthew Mondares\r\nThe goal was to explore the spread of information generated by Twitter bots during the 2018 California Camp Fire disaster utilizing user-user and hashtag co-occurrence networks. Twitter bots are users who have automated repetitive and straightforward tweets. Most of them post, repost, or like other tweets to spread information faster than actual users for an unknown large-scale goal.\r\nReport:\r\nTwitter Network Analysis of the California Camp Fire\r\nPredictive Modeling of Flood Susceptibility\r\nCollaborators: Madeline Brown, Ritesh Sharma, & Umesh Krishnamurthy\r\nThis project was about modeling flood risk given multiple factors such as scale, demographics, risk perceptions, topology, soil moisture, and precipitation. The general goal was to develop a model for real-time predictions to alert and inform communities of flood risks.\r\nPresentation:\r\nPredictive Modeling of Flood Susceptibility: Phase 1\r\nModeling Spider Predation\r\nCollaborators: Michele Lynn Joyner, Edith Seier, Chelsea Ross, J Colton Watts, Nathaniel Hancock, Michael Largent, & Thomas C. Jones. 2\r\nThe goal of this study was to model the predation movements of the spider species Anelosimus Studiosus using stochastic differential equations.\r\nPublications:\r\n2016 Journal of theoretical biology\r\n2015 Mathematical biosciences and engineering\r\nPosters:\r\nA Stochastic Model for Cooperative Hunting of a Subsocial Arachnid\r\nExpansion of a Stochastic Model for Anelosimus Studiosus Movement During Prey Capture\r\n\r\nThese collaborators where undergraduate students during the time of the project.↩︎\r\nI was an undergraduate student for the duration of the project.↩︎\r\n",

I start with the big picture and then fill in the details later. This holistic perspective has helped me throughout my educational journey, and I believe it is essential for all students.\r\nI think that there are three critical elements of education: student-centered learning, an inclusive classroom, and diversified grading systems and teaching tools.\r\nStudent-centered learning is important because it allows students to learn in a way that is most effective for them. I use a variety of instructional methods to engage students, such as group activities, worksheets, visualizations, and traditional lectures. I also provide detailed feedback and support so that students can reach their full potential.\r\nAn inclusive classroom is meaningful because it creates a safe and welcoming environment where all students feel welcome, respected, and supported. I create an inclusive classroom by using inclusive language, celebrating diversity, and being aware of and addressing bias.\r\nDiversified grading systems and teaching tools are essential because they allow me to assess student learning in a fair and equitable way. I use a variety of grading methods and teaching tools, such as proficiency-based grading system, rubrics, portfolios, and self-assessment. This allows me to assess student learning in a way that is tailored to each student’s individual needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
